## Food Ordering Kiosk with Management Interface and Order Wallboard

This project involved the design and development of a self-service food ordering kiosk. The kiosk features an intuitive touch-screen interface that allows customers to easily browse the menu, select products, and customize their orders.

## Key functionalities include:

* **Product Management Screen**: Administrators can easily add, update, or remove menu items, set availability, and adjust pricing.

* **Order Processing Screen**: A real-time view of all incoming orders, allowing staff to monitor order status, prioritize preparations, and track order completion.

* **Orders Wallboard**: A large display visible to customers, showing the status of their orders are ready for Pickup, ensuring a seamless and organized customer experience.

The system integrates with the kitchen workflow, optimizing order handling and reducing service time. Additionally, it offers a streamlined experience for both customers and staff, enhancing operational efficiency.
